I'm an Indie Hacker and I've decided to make my app free. Sounds like a terrible decision, right?

I'm making a [browser extension](https://zimu.ai) that provides smart subtitles for Chinese videos. Am I Indie Hacking mainly to make money? Definitely not. If I wanted to make money there's the risk free alternative of regular employment. Then is it to become rich? Clearly not, a one-man project is unlikely to generate that kind of revenue. Why a one-man project then? It's mainly that at this point in our life with small kids, we want as much freedom as possible. Involving other people means meetings, discussions, aligning visions and work hours. 

No, what I really want is to cover our expenses as a family while creating as much value as possible. So the calculus is simple: maximize the "value" I can provide to other people, i.e. "number of users" times "value provided per user", subject to the constraint of paying our bills at some point in the future.

I'm making a language learning app (actually, browser extension) for Chinese. There are plenty of those already, free and paid, but I think I'm providing something fairly special (otherwise I wouldn't do it). 

There seems to be three kinds of language learning apps or tools:

1. VC funded startups or mature companies, mostly targeting multiple language at once. Think Duolingo. These services provide a little value to a lot of people. Since they have to target multiple languages to get enough user growth, the experience for any particular language is typically suboptimal. They might have large teams working on multiple languages, but their apps have a common base, not allowing much specialization for particular languages. Even if they only target a single language (like HelloChinese), they will have to cater mostly to beginners, because there are not enough intermediate and advanced users to sustain the necessary growth.
2. Niche tools that are often free or open source. These provide a lot of value to a few people, usually power users. Since they're free and open source the creator might not afford to work full time on them, limiting the scope and usability. Think Anki
3. Paid or Freemium subscription services with small teams. These small to medium user base, perhaps hundreds or a few thousand users, usually focusing on a single language. Think Pleco or Skritter.

For an Indie Hacker, alternative 3 seems like the only path. But I don't like it, why? Because it really limits your reach and impact. Even though it's easier than ever before, it's still very difficult to get people to pay for software, especially if it doesn't solve an extremely painful problem in their life. If you're making an Indie language learning product I think you'd be lucky to reach a few hundred or low thousands of paid users, while there are probably millions of people learning that could benefit from it.
