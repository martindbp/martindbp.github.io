I'm a native Swedish speaker, but I rarely consume content in Swedish. I suspect this confuses friends and family, and perhaps makes me look like a snob ("Oh, I don't watch (Swedish) TV"). It hasn't always been a conscious choice, but it's become one now.


The answer is simple: it's just not very likely to be the best of its kind out there. Sweden has a population of roughly 10 million and there are 1.5 billion English speakers in the world. Content produced for the English market has to be much better to be noticed. Brilliant minds who get to apply themselves are presumably uniformly distributed in the developed world, in both science and art.


And this to me seems to hold, as whenever I consume some Swedish content on a topic I'm already familiar with what I get is basically a watered-down retelling of an English-published source, 3 years later. Very rarely are the original thinkers Swedish.


Therefore, I'll stick to English material unless:
1. It's is something uniquely Swedish / cultural, e.g. comedy, music
2. It looks like an outlier in terms of popularity, when it comes to entertainment
3. It's by someone well respected internationally, e.g. Hans Rosling, Max Tegmark
4. There is no English substitue
