Hi there, this is where I post random thoughts, analyses and (side)projects. My
background is in image processing, computer vision and machine learning, with a
bit of back-end programming thrown in for good measure.

Currently I'm taking a break from regular employement, instead trying to bring
Value To The Peopleâ„¢ by way of [zimu.ai](https://zimu.ai).

Here is a list of other things I've done / written about:

* [Solving Minesweeper](posts/minesweeper/)
* ["Can I Say This In Chinese" with BERT](posts/can-i-say-this/)
* [Chinese Placement Test with Logistic Regression and Active Learning](posts/chinese-placement-test/)
* [Are parents picking less common names?](posts/name-statistics/)

Github projects:

* [MerkL: ML pipelines based on Merkle DAGs](https://github.com/martindbp/merkl)
* [Inter-Planetary Version Control: An implementation of a git-like DVCS on top of IPFS](https://github.com/martindbp/ipvc)
