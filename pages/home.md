Hi there, welcome to my little space on the interwebs! This is where I post random thoughts, analyses and side-projects. Day to day I work mostly with Computer Vision and Machine Learning. In my spare time I split my time between trying to learn Chinese and trying to improve the learning process. Here is a list of things I've done / written about:

* ["Can I Say This In Chinese" with BERT (Part 1)](posts/can-i-say-this/)
* [Chinese Placement Test with Logistic Regression and Active Learning](posts/chinese-placement-test/)
