Hi there, my name is Martin Pettersson, and this is where I post
random thoughts, analyses and (side)projects. My background is in image
processing, computer vision and machine learning, with a bit of back-end
programming thrown in for good measure.

Currently I'm taking a break from regular employement, instead trying to bring
Value To The Peopleâ„¢ by way of [zimu.ai](zimu.ai). It's a browser extension providing captions and subtitles for
pretty much any Chinese video online, using Computer Vision and ML to extract them, then personalizing them for Chinese learners.

Here is a list of other things I've done / written about:

* [Solving Minesweeper](posts/minesweeper/)
* ["Can I Say This In Chinese" with BERT](posts/can-i-say-this/)
* [Chinese Placement Test with Logistic Regression and Active Learning](posts/chinese-placement-test/)
* [Are parents picking less common names?](posts/name-statistics/)

Github projects:

* [MerkL: ML pipelines based on Merkle DAGs](https://github.com/martindbp/merkl)
* [Inter-Planetary Version Control: An implementation of a git-like DVCS on top of IPFS](https://github.com/martindbp/ipvc)
